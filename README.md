# Digits of π from Colliding Blocks

Solution to the challenge proposed by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs) to prove that the number of clacks between two colliding blocks and a fixed wall is equal to *d* digits of π when their masses satisfy <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$M/m&space;=&space;100^{d-1}$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$M/m&space;=&space;100^{d-1}$" title="$M/m = 100^{d-1}$" /></a>.
